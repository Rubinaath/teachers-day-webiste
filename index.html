            <p>Teacher’s Day in India is celebrated on the 5th of September each year. Schools throughout our country
                are decorated and special events are organized <br /> to celebrate this event. Students as well as

                usual
                school
                activities. <br /> So students particularly look after this day.<br /></p>

            <h2>Why is Teacher’s Day Celebrated on 5th September?</h2>
            <p>5th September is the birth anniversary of Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan. Dr. Radhakrishnan was the first
                Vice President of India. He served the nation from the year<br /> 1952 to 1962. He also served the
                country
                as
                its second President from 1962 to 1967.

                Dr. Radhakrishnan held great regards for the teachers. Before entering politics,<br /> he taught at
                different
                universities including the University of Calcutta, University of Mysore and University of Oxford. He was
                appreciated for his work and was immensely <br />loved by his students. He believed that it is the
                teachers
                who shape the youth who in turn shape the future of the nation. This is the reason he did his job as a
                professor<br /> diligently and gave good values to his students.<br />
                <br />

                When he became the president of our country, his students expressed the wish to celebrate his birthday
                each year. Responding to them, Dr. Radhakrishnan said,<br /> he would be rather glad if they celebrate
                5th
                September as Teachers’ Day. Thus, his birthday is celebrated as Teachers’ Day every year.

            <h2>The Importance of Teachers’ Day</h2>
            <p>
                Teachers’ Day is of utmost importance. It is a day to respect and value the efforts of the teachers who
                work
                tirelessly all year round. Teachers’ <br />job is one of the toughest jobs in the world as they are
                given
                the
                responsibility to nurture young minds. They are given a class full of students. <br />Each student is
                unique
                and
                has a different calibre. Some students may be good in Sports others could be Maths genius while others
                may
                show keen<br /> interest in English. A good teacher helps the students explore their interest and
                identify
                their
                capabilities. She/he encourages the students to hone their<br /> skills in the subjects or activities
                they
                are
                interested in and at the same time ensures they do not neglect other subjects or academics as a whole.

                <br />The reason why a special day has been dedicated to people belonging to this profession is to give
                them
                respect and express gratitude.
